> A Python library for zero-configuration, OS-independent asset management.

`some-asm` is a Python library designed to automatically discover and provide an intuitive API to access project files, eliminating the need for hardcoded relative paths.

> **Note:** This library is part of the Prism ecosystem, designed to create a seamless bridge between your database and client applications.

## ðŸš¦ Getting Started

### Installation
The preferred installation method is:
```bash
# Using uv as package manager
uv sync
```

#### Quick Start
Here's a minimal example to get you started:
```bash
# Using uv to run the main script
uv run src/main.py
```

## Considerations
- The project is currently in development, which means that some features might not be fully functional yet.
- The python files marked with `example_*.py` are from previous iterations of the tool. They are not currently active but remain available for reference or potential future integration.

## Setup
The current python version is `3.11.*`. It is recommended to use the same version to avoid any issues.

This project uses `uv` to manage the python environment.

- Create and activate the virtual environment
```bash
# Using uv as package manager
uv sync  # create the environment and install dependencies
```

- Run the project from the root directory
```bash
# Using uv to run the main script
uv run src/main.py  # run the main file
```
